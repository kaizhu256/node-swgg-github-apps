Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact GitHub support.\nFor more information about GitHub Marketplace, see \&quot;GitHub Marketplace.\&quot;\nNote: This preview includes methods for testing with stubbed data. Stubbed data is fake data that's useful for testing your GitHub Apps. Stubbed data is hard-coded and will not change based on actual subscriptions.\nTo test with stubbed data, use a stubbed endpoint in place of its production counterpart. This allows you to test whether API logic succeeds before listing GitHub Apps on GitHub Marketplace.\nBe sure to replace stubbed endpoints with production endpoints before deploying your GitHub App.\nEndpoints for /marketplace_listing/* and /user/marketplace_purchases are only accessible by OAuth Apps using client_id and secret basic authentication or by GitHub Apps using a JWT.\n-\nFor API authentication for GitHub Marketplace listings associated with an OAuth App, see \&quot;Authorization options for OAuth Apps.\&quot;\n-\nFor API authentication for GitHub Marketplace listings associated with a GitHub App, see \&quot;Authentication options for GitHub Apps.\&quot;\nInstallations\nFor information on how to authenticate as an installation, see \&quot;Authentication Options for GitHub Apps.\&quot;\nNote: To access the API with your integration, you must provide a custom media type in the Accept Header for your requests.\napplication/vnd.github.machine-man-preview+json\n\n                                        https://developer.github.com/v3/index.html#user-agent-required\nAll API requests MUST include a valid User-Agent header.

# [GitHub Marketplace]()

**Note:** The The GitHub Marketplace API on GitHub is currently available for developers to preview. To access the API, you must provide a custom [media type]() in the ```Accept``` header:
```
application/vnd.github.valkyrie-preview+json
```

**Warning:** The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact [GitHub support]().

For more information about GitHub Marketplace, see "[GitHub Marketplace]()."

**Note:** This preview includes methods for testing with **stubbed data**. Stubbed data is fake data that's useful for testing your GitHub Apps. Stubbed data is hard-coded and will not change based on actual subscriptions.

To test with stubbed data, use a stubbed endpoint in place of its production counterpart. This allows you to test whether API logic succeeds before listing GitHub Apps on GitHub Marketplace.

Be sure to replace stubbed endpoints with production endpoints before deploying your GitHub App.

Endpoints for ```/marketplace_listing/*``` and ```/user/marketplace_purchases``` are only accessible by OAuth Apps using ```client_id``` and ```secret``` basic authentication or by [GitHub Apps using a JWT]().
-

For API authentication for GitHub Marketplace listings associated with an OAuth App, see "[Authorization options for OAuth Apps]()."
-

For API authentication for GitHub Marketplace listings associated with a GitHub App, see "[Authentication options for GitHub Apps]()."

# [Installations]()

For information on how to authenticate as an installation, see "[Authentication Options for GitHub Apps]()."

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The The GitHub Marketplace API on GitHub is currently available for developers to preview. To access the API, you must provide a custom <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/media">media type</a> in the <code>Accept</code> header:</p>
<pre><code>application/vnd.github.valkyrie-preview+json
</code></pre><p><strong>Warning:</strong> The API may change without advance notice during the preview period. Preview features are not supported for production use. If you experience any issues, contact <a href="https://github.com/contact">GitHub support</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about GitHub Marketplace, see "<a href="https://developer.github.com/apps/marketplace/">GitHub Marketplace</a>."</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This preview includes methods for testing with <strong>stubbed data</strong>. Stubbed data is fake data that's useful for testing your GitHub Apps. Stubbed data is hard-coded and will not change based on actual subscriptions.</p>
<p>To test with stubbed data, use a stubbed endpoint in place of its production counterpart. This allows you to test whether API logic succeeds before listing GitHub Apps on GitHub Marketplace.</p>
<p>Be sure to replace stubbed endpoints with production endpoints before deploying your GitHub App.</p>
<p>Endpoints for <code>/marketplace_listing/*</code> and <code>/user/marketplace_purchases</code> are only accessible by OAuth Apps using <code>client_id</code> and <code>secret</code> basic authentication or by <a href="https://developer.github.com/apps/building-github-apps/authentication-options-for-github-apps/#authenticating-as-a-github-app">GitHub Apps using a JWT</a>.
